# Context
- **NFL Season:** {{YEAR}}
- **Week:** {{WEEK_NUMBER}}
- **Date:** {{DATE}}
- **Slate Description:** {{SLATE_DESCRIPTION}}
- **ESPN Game Data:** {{ESPN_GAME_DATA_LINK}}

# Game Focus
Focus on: {{FOCUS_GAMES}}

# Analysis Requirements
- Minimum {{MIN_ARTICLES_FOR_SENTIMENT}} articles for sentiment analysis
- Include long shots: {{INCLUDE_LONG_SHOTS}}
- Prop focus: {{PROP_FOCUS}}

# CRITICAL: Minimum Player Requirements
You MUST provide AT LEAST the following number of players per category:
- **QBs**: Minimum 5 players
- **RBs**: Minimum 5 players
- **WRs**: Minimum 5 players
- **TEs**: Minimum 5 players

If fewer quality options exist, include lower-confidence plays but mark them with verified: false.

# Value Tier Guidelines
Categorize each player's value tier in the matchup_note (prepend to existing note):
- **[Elite]** ($8,000+) - Premium plays with high floors
- **[Mid-Tier]** ($6,000-$7,999) - Balanced value options
- **[Value]** ($4,000-$5,999) - Budget-friendly plays
- **[Punt]** (<$4,000) - Minimum salary options

Example: "[Mid-Tier] Favorable matchup against weak secondary..."

# Data Quality Standards
- Set verified: true only when 3+ quality sources agree
- Set verified: false when data is limited or conflicting
- In matchup_note, mention if data is sparse (e.g., "Limited data available")
- Always provide reasoning even with limited data

# Live Game Data

# Task
Provide comprehensive DFS and prop betting recommendations based on the games above:

1. **Top DFS Core Plays by Position**
   - QB, RB, WR, TE picks (MINIMUM 5 EACH - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   - Include value tier tag in matchup_note
   - Salary considerations and stacking opportunities
   - Matchup analysis based on actual opponents

2. **Prop Betting Recommendations**
   - Player props (TDs, yards, receptions)
   - Game-specific props based on matchups
   - Confidence levels tied to data quality (verified field)
   - **CRITICAL**: For EVERY prop suggestion, you MUST provide a clear "lean" (over/under or yes/no)
   - Prop focus preference: {{PROP_FOCUS}}
     * If "overs": Slightly favor over recommendations when confidence is similar
     * If "unders": Slightly favor under recommendations when confidence is similar
     * If "mix": Provide balanced mix of overs and unders based purely on analysis
   - Always show your lean regardless of focus preference - the focus only affects which props you emphasize when multiple good options exist

3. **Sleepers and Value Plays**
   - Under-the-radar options from the games above
   - Stack recommendations for specific games
   - Highlight [Value] and [Punt] tier plays

4. **Data Quality Notes**
   - Flag players with limited data (verified: false)
   - Note when consensus is weak
   - Provide reasoning even with uncertainty

IMPORTANT:
- Base recommendations on specific games and matchups listed above
- Reference actual team names and matchups from game data
- MUST meet minimum player counts per category (5 each for QB/RB/WR/TE)
- Include value tier tag for EVERY player in matchup_note
- Flag data quality issues appropriately with verified field
