If fewer quality options exist, include lower-confidence plays but mark them with verified: false.

# Value Tier Guidelines
Categorize each player's value tier in the matchup_note (prepend to existing note):
- **[Elite]** ($8,000+) - Premium plays with high floors
- **[Mid-Tier]** ($6,000-$7,999) - Balanced value options
- **[Value]** ($4,000-$5,999) - Budget-friendly plays
- **[Punt]** (<$4,000) - Minimum salary options

Example: "[Mid-Tier] Favorable matchup against weak secondary..."

# Data Quality Standards
- Set verified: true only when 3+ quality sources agree
- Set verified: false when data is limited or conflicting
- In matchup_note, mention if data is sparse (e.g., "Limited data available")
- Always provide reasoning even with limited data

# CRITICAL PLAYER VALIDATION RULES

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY:**

1. **ONLY recommend players listed in the depth charts above**
2. **Verify each player's team matches the depth chart data EXACTLY**
3. **Cross-reference player names exactly as shown in depth charts**
4. **If a player is not in the depth charts, DO NOT include them**
5. **Focus on players mentioned in articles who are ALSO on current rosters**
6. **When in doubt about a player's current team, CHECK THE DEPTH CHART FIRST**

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- DO NOT use outdated team assignments (e.g., Derrick Henry is on Baltimore Ravens, NOT Tennessee Titans)
- DO NOT include players who have been traded or released
- DO NOT guess at team assignments - use the depth chart as your source of truth
- DO NOT include practice squad players not listed in depth charts

**Validation Process:**
For EVERY player you recommend:
1. Find their name in the depth chart above
2. Confirm their current team from the depth chart
3. Use that exact team name in your recommendation
4. If you cannot find them in the depth chart, exclude them from recommendations

# Task
Provide comprehensive DFS and prop betting recommendations based on the games above:

1. **Top DFS Core Plays by Position**
   - QB, RB, WR, TE picks (MINIMUM 5 EACH - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   - Include value tier tag in matchup_note
   - Salary considerations and stacking opportunities
   - Matchup analysis based on actual opponents

2. **Prop Betting Recommendations**
   - Player props (TDs, yards, receptions)
   - Game-specific props based on matchups
   - Confidence levels tied to data quality (verified field)
   - **CRITICAL**: For EVERY prop suggestion, you MUST provide a clear "lean" (over/under or yes/no)
   - Prop focus preference: {{PROP_FOCUS}}
     * If "overs": Slightly favor over recommendations when confidence is similar
     * If "unders": Slightly favor under recommendations when confidence is similar
     * If "mix": Provide balanced mix of overs and unders based purely on analysis
   - Always show your lean regardless of focus preference - the focus only affects which props you emphasize when multiple good options exist

3. **Sleepers and Value Plays**
   - Under-the-radar options from the games above
   - Stack recommendations for specific games
   - Highlight [Value] and [Punt] tier plays

4. **Data Quality Notes**
   - Flag players with limited data (verified: false)
   - Note when consensus is weak
   - Provide reasoning even with uncertainty

IMPORTANT:
- **VERIFY ALL PLAYERS AGAINST THE DEPTH CHART ABOVE BEFORE INCLUDING THEM**
- Base recommendations on specific games and matchups listed above
- Reference actual team names and matchups from game data
- Use EXACT team names from the depth chart (e.g., "Baltimore Ravens" not "Ravens")
- MUST meet minimum player counts per category (5 each for QB/RB/WR/TE)
- Include value tier tag for EVERY player in matchup_note
- Flag data quality issues appropriately with verified field
- **Double-check that every player's team assignment matches the depth chart**
